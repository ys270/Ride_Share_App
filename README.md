# How to use the web app


First, go to http://vcm-xxxxx.vm.duke.edu:8000/app/login, because at first we do not have any users and rides, click on the sign up button and use a valid email address and the password you like to create a new user.


After that, the website will automatically jump to the login page. Type in the email and password you just set, and this will lead you to the main page of our app.


Because you are currently not a driver, there are 5 basic functions (any user can have) on the mainpage:



Request a Ride:
If you click on this link, it will lead you to a form to request a ride. You   need to fill up everything in the form to successfully request a ride. Also, the ride owner's party size need to be smaller than the car size and the arrival time you choose need to be later than the current time. If you select the wrong things inside the form, there will be an error message ask you to go back to the main page to request the ride again. If you successfully request the ride, a message of "you successfully requested a ride" will be printed and you can go back to the mainpage.

Join a Ride:
Assume now you have created some other users and they requested some rides.  Click on the join ride link and type in some kind of share condition for your shared ride, if there are rides suitable for you to ride, you can choose one to join, if there is not, there would be a message saying no such kind of ride.

My Ride as the Owner:
If you click on this link, it will lead you to the next page which has two links:

My Owned Open Rides:

If you have open rides as the owner, they will all be listed on this page. If you want to see more details about one particular ride or edit  information of a ride, you can choose the dot before the ride and click on the choose button. This will make you see the current information of the ride and you can edit this ride's details in the form below. Note that if the ride already has sharers, you cannot edit this ride anymore.


My Owned Confirmed Rides:

If you have open rides as the owner, they will all be listed on this page. If you want to see more details about one particular ride, you can choose the dot before the ride and click on the choose button.
